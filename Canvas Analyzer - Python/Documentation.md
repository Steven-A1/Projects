# Canvas Analyzer Documentation

## Summary
canvas_analyzer.py is the file I worked on to gather information from Canvas, a Learning Management System that gives students access to information on their courses.
The analyzer gives the user a list of courses they are enrolled in, they then choose which one they would like a statistical summary of. 
The statistical summary would be of the grades the student has in those courses.

The other py files are supplemental code supplied by my professor Austin Cory Bart that make the code run.
